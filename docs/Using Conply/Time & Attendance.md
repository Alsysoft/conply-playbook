<h2>Time & Attendance</h2>

The Time & Attendance feature provides admins with the ability to accurately track the working hours of each user and generate comprehensive reports. These reports can be exported in PDF and CSV formats or sent via email, offering a robust tool for workforce management.

<h2>Filters</h2>

Filters are essential for customizing Time & Attendance reports. In the top section of the Time & Attendance module, you will find various filter settings that can be configured and saved in the filters' gallery:

* User Group: Choose specific groups of users based on predefined criteria to narrow down the report's focus.

* Device / Location: Select from all the available locations within the organization, allowing you to track time and attendance based on specific work sites or areas.

* User: Further refine your report by choosing individual users from the selected user group or include all users within the same user group.

* Save and Reuse Filters: You have the option to save your customized filters, allowing you to conveniently reuse them in future reports. This time-saving feature streamlines the report generation process for recurring analyses.

Calendar:

The Calendar button is a powerful tool that allows you to specify the timeframe for your Time & Attendance reports. You can choose to:

* Pick a Day: Select a specific day to generate a report for that single day's data.

* Date Range (Including Current Day): Define a date range that spans from your chosen start date to the current day. This is particularly useful for reviewing time and attendance data over a period of time.

<h2>Generating Reports and Exporting Data:</h2>

Once the filters are set to your preferences, you can generate detailed reports that contain crucial information such as:

* User names
* Company or group affiliations
* Trade and device information
* Date and timestamps for clocking in and out
* Total number of hours worked

You can generate data based on a specific time frame by selecting dates using the date-picker located in the top-right input area. After configuring the filters and setting the desired time frame, you can export the data by simply clicking on the "Export" button with options for:
* Export as PDF
* Export as CSV
* Send via Email

These versatile export options offer admins the flexibility to choose the most suitable format for sharing, analyzing, and assisting in payroll processing. This robust feature allows organizations to effectively manage and monitor employee working hours, helping to ensure accurate time tracking, reporting, and streamlined payroll procedures for better workforce management.
