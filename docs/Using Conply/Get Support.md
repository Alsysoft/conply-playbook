<h2>How to Get Support</h2>
<b>Access the Help Desk:</b>
<p>To begin the support process, please visit our Help Desk by clicking <a href="https://alsysdesk.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals">here</a>.</p>

<b>Category Selection:</b>
<p>Select the appropriate category or department related to your issue. This will help us route your request to the right team, ensuring a faster response.</p>

<b>Create a Ticket:</b>
<p>Once on the Help Desk page, you can create a support ticket for your issue. Provide a detailed description of the problem you're facing and any relevant information, such as error messages or screenshots.</p>

<b>Description:</b>
<p>In the "Description" field, provide a detailed explanation of the issue you are experiencing. Be as specific as possible, including any error messages, relevant circumstances, or steps you've taken so far. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for the support team to understand and resolve your problem effectively.</p>

<b>How it Reproduces:</b>
<p>Describe the steps or conditions that lead to the issue occurring. Providing a clear outline of how the problem can be reproduced helps the support team replicate the issue on their end, which is essential for troubleshooting.</p>

<b>Severity:</b>
<p>Write down the severity level that best represents the impact of the issue. Severity levels we suggest:</p>

* Critical: The problem has a severe impact and may disrupt critical operations.
* High: The issue has a significant impact but does not critically disrupt operations.
* Medium: The problem has a moderate impact, causing some inconvenience but not critical.
* Low: The issue has a minor impact, causing minimal disruption.

<b>Frequency:</b>
<p>Indicate how often the issue occurs. Is it a constant problem, sporadic, or a one-time occurrence? Providing the frequency helps the support team understand the persistence of the issue, which can be valuable for diagnosing root causes.</p>

<b>What Effects it Has:</b>
<p>Detail the specific consequences or effects the issue has on your operations, workflow, or system. Explain any business impacts or inconveniences caused by the problem. This information gives the support team insight into the importance of resolving the issue.</p>

<b>Attachments:</b>
<p>If you have any files or documents relevant to your request, you can attach them to the ticket for better understanding.</p>

<b>Submit Your Ticket:</b>
<p>Review the information you've provided, and when you're ready, click the "Submit" button to create your support ticket.</p>

<br/>

<p><i>Including these fields in your support ticket not only helps the support team diagnose and address your issue more effectively but also ensures that they fully understand the context and impact of the problem, allowing for a more tailored and efficient response.</i></p>

<br/>

<b>What to Expect</b>
<p>Once your support ticket is submitted, you will receive an acknowledgment email confirming that we've received your request. Our support team will then assess your issue and work diligently to provide you with a solution.</p>
