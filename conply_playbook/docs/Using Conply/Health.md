<h2>Setting Up the Health Section for Onboarding</h2>

This functionality allows organizations to request the Health status of each inductee during the Onboarding phase. Please note that this step can be skipped if the organization chooses not to utilize it. Additionally, Health status can be verified or updated later, even for users who are already inducted.

1. Access the Health Tab
Open the application and navigate to the "Health" tab in the main menu.
2. Create Health Questionnaire
Click the "Add Questions" button to begin setting up the questionnaire. This step is essential if the organization wishes to collect Health status information during the Onboarding phase.
3.  Add Details Field (Optional)
For questions that require additional details, you can click on the "Request details" button.
4. Save Questions
After creating each question, save it using the "Save" button. Continue to add questions until your questionnaire is comprehensive.
5. Publish the Questionnaire
Once your questionnaire is prepared, and the list is complete, click on the "Send to recipients" button. This action will open a screen displaying all users within the organization. You can select the recipients by choosing User Groups, Users, or Locations. After making your selections, click the "Send" button to ensure the questionnaire is available for the designated recipients.
