<h2>General Induction</h2>

General Induction is a one-time procedure that is part of the Onboarding process for employees who have accepted an invitation from their organization.
It may include videos, images, or documents that provide support information for the questionnaire.
General Induction can be edited but cannot be removed as it's a mandatory part of the Onboarding.

<h2>Specific Induction</h2>

Specific Inductions are available for certain locations and contain different content.
These are not part of the Onboarding process and can be accessed in the Home menu.
Similar to General Inductions, Specific Inductions may include videos, images, or documents that support the questionnaire.


<h2>Setting Up General or Specific Inductions</h2>

Whether you want to create a General or Specific Induction, the setup process is similar. Here's how to do it:

1.  Access the Induction Tab

In the web browser platform, tap on the "Induction" tab in the navigation drawer.

2. Choose the Type of Induction

Select between "General" and "Specific."

3. General Induction (If Selected)

General Induction can only be edited, not removed, as it's a mandatory part of the Onboarding process.
You can edit the General Induction by replacing the video and editing the questionnaire. This is typically set up during organization Onboarding.

4. Specific Induction

You can add as many Specific Inductions as needed.
Tap on the "Add Induction" button in the top right corner to create a new Specific Induction.

5. Fill in the Required Information

On the left side, provide a unique Name for your induction to differentiate it and choose a Location to specify where it should be sent to for users.
Upload a video and enable an option to skip the video on the second watch.
On the right side, add questions, typically based on the attached video. At least one question with two answers is required to create the induction.
Once you've filled in all the information, click the "Save" button.

6. Save & Send the Induction

The induction will be saved and sent to the recipients selected based on their location.
